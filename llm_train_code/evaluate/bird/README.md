## Overview

BIRD-SQL is the first cross-domain large-scale benchmark specifically designed to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications in the field of text-to-SQL parsing. While models such as Codex and ChatGPT have demonstrated remarkable performance, existing benchmarks such as Spider and WikiSQL concentrate primarily on database schema, leaving database contents largely unexplored. Realizing this limitation, we set out to create a comprehensive benchmark that delves deeper into database values, ultimately unveiling new challenges and opportunities for developments in the text-to-SQL domain.

BIRD-SQL is distinguished by its large dataset, which includes **12,751** text-to-SQL pairs, **95** databases encompassing **37** professional domains, and a total size of **33.4 GB**. By highlighting database values, BIRD-SQL draws attention to new challenges, such as external knowledge, dirty data, and SQL efficiency in vast databases. In order to generate accurate SQL queries, models must not only conduct semantic parsing but also comprehend database values.

## Dataset Introduction

The dataset contains the main following resources:

- `database`: The database should be stored under the [`./data/dev_databases/`](./data/dev_databases/). In each database folder, it has two components:
  - `database_description`: the csv files are manufactured to describe database schema and its values for models to explore or references.
  - `sqlite`: The database contents in BIRD.
- `data`: Each text-to-SQL pairs with the oracle knowledge evidence is stored as a json file, i.e., `dev.json` is stored on [`./data/dev.json`](./data/dev.json). In each json file, it has three main parts:
  - `db_id`: the names of databases
  - `question`: the questions curated by human crowdsourcing according to database descriptions, database contents.
  - `evidence`: the external knowledge evidence annotated by experts for assistance of models or SQL annotators.
  - `SQL`: SQLs annotated by crowdsource referring to database descriptions, database contents, to answer the questions accurately.
- `llm`: It contains source codes to convert texts to SQLs by calling APIs from LLMs, such as `code-davinci-002`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
- `finetuning`: It contains the codes for supervised fine-tuning T5, a prevalent sequence-to-sequence pre-trained language model, to perform text-to-SQL task in BIRD.

## Fine-tuning (FT)

### Environment Setup:

To train T5 via an end-to-end FT method, please first create enviroments following [`UnifiedSKG`](https://github.com/HKUNLP/UnifiedSKG).
You may also need to download the third party packages for evaluations:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

```bash
cd ./finetuning/
conda env create -f finetuning
conda activate finetuning
# install the hugginface package: datasets according to your version.
pip install datasets
# The following line to be replaced depending on your cuda version.
pip install torch==1.11.0+cu113 torchvision==0.12.0+cu113 torchaudio==0.11.0 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
```

### Training:

All parameters and attempts are stored in the [`./finetuning/run/`](./finetuning/run/). Please start training by the following commands:

```bash
sh ./run/run_bird_large.sh
```

## In-Context Learning (ICL):

### Environment Setup:

First, you need install openai in your python environment by:

```bash
pip install openai
```

### Collect results

Then you could directly execute the command line by following instructions (you may need to adjust paramters and paths with your preference):

```bash
cd ./llm/
sh ./run/run_gpt.sh
```

## Evaluation:

### Execution (EX) Evaluation:

Please post-process your collected results as the format: SQL and its `db_id`, which is splitted by `'\t----- bird -----\t'`. The examples are shown in the [`./llm/exp_result/turbo_output/predict_dev.json`](./llm/exp_result/turbo_output/predict_dev.json). Put the ground-truth sql file in the [`./data/`](./data/). And you may need to design a ChatGPT tag by your own.
Then you could evaluate the results by the following command line:

```bash
cd ./llm/
sh ./run/run_evaluation.sh
```

### Valid Efficiency Score (VES) Evaluation (time-mainly):

Most of procedures are the similar to EX evaluation, just run the command:

```bash
cd ./llm/
sh ./run/run_evaluation_ves.sh
```

## Acknowledgement

We thank Xin Yan for active involvement in ChatGPT prompt design, discussion, and figure creation in the HKU STAR Lab. We thank Jan Motl, Oliver Schulte for valuable suggestions and assistance in maintaining the databases from [`https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/`](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/).

## Call for Calibration

In this work, we are committed to delivering high-quality datasets to boost the development of text-to-SQL research. Despite our hard efforts in evaluating and refining this benchmark with ~700 hours, we acknowledge that errors and ambiguities may still exist. To ensure long-term contributions to the text-to-SQLs, we are actively soliciting community feedback on possible enhancements to our datasets.

We will also polish this benchmark periodically. Therefore, We would be grateful if you could provide any feedback regarding errors or future directions to BIRD. Let's contribute to the future of text-to-SQL research. Thank you for your support!
