    "0": "To find the highest eligible free rate for K-12 students in the schools in Alameda County, you would need to join the `frpm` and `satscores` tables on the `CDSCode` column and then group the results by the `CDSCode` and calculate the average of the `FRPM Count (K-12)` and `Enrollment (K-12)` columns. Finally, you would need to divide the average `FRPM Count (K-12)` by the average `Enrollment (K-12)` to get the eligible free rate.\n\nHere is the SQL query that would accomplish this:\n```\nSELECT AVG(FRPMCount) / AVG(Enrollment) AS EligibleFreeRate\nFROM frpm\nJOIN satscores ON frpm.CDSCode = satscores.cds\nWHERE frpm.CountyCode = 3 AND satscores.rtype = 'K-12'\nGROUP BY frpm.CDSCode\nORDER BY EligibleFreeRate DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\nThis query will return the highest eligible free rate for K-12 students in the schools in\t----- bird -----\tcalifornia_schools"
