The `JOIN` keyword is used to join the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables on the `ID` column.\n4. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include male patients (by checking the `SEX` column) and patients with a normal range `GOT` value (by checking the `GOT` column and using the condition `GOT < 60`).\n\nNote that the external knowledge \"male refers to Sex = 'M'\" is used in the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include male patients.\t----- bird -----\tthrombosis_prediction",
